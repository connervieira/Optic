## Description

Optic is a graphical interface for controlling Predator's dashcam functionality. Optic is designed to run on a low-powered computer, alongside Predator, and provides a simple interface for controlling dashcam recording over a network. Users can connect to Optic from a phone, tablet, or other network-enabled device with a web browser. Full installations can even include a dedicated control interface.

While the initial installation and setup process requires some technical knowledge, Optic is designed to be extremely easy to use after the configuration process is completed. As such, users who want to take advantage of Predator's dashcam functionality can have their installer setup Predator and Optic on their behalf.


## Features

### Simple

After the initial setup is complete, Optic is intended to be simple and easy to use, just like a commercially available dashcam would be. As such, any driver comfortable using a traditional dashcam should have no problem using Optic.

### Reliable

Optic is designed to be reliable, in the sense that it can detect and notify the user when problems are encountered. Optic can display errors and warnings directly from Predator, and has its own diagnostic capabilities built in.

### Compatible

Optic works through nearly any web browser, and doesn't even require JavaScript for its core functionality. Whether you're using a modern fully-featured browser, or a minimalist lightweight one, Optic should work great.

### Lightweight

Optic is designed to be extremely lightweight, both in terms of network resources and processing power. While low latency is very beneficial, Optic doesn't need high bandwidth to function well.

### Adaptive

The Optic interface is designed to make the most of the available screen space, regardless of whether it is used from a large desktop monitor or a small smartphone display.

### Customizable

Optic allows the user to customize both the Optic interface itself, as well as certain Predator configuration values to match their needs, all from the web interface.
