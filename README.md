# Optic

A graphical dashcam interface for [Predator](https://v0lttech.com/predator.php).


## Note

Optic is dependent on [Predator](https://v0lttech.com/predator.php) to function, and does not provide any useful functionality alone. Before installing Optic, Predator needs to be installed and configured.


## Documentation

To learn more about installing, configuring, and using Optic, see the [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md) file.


## Description

Optic is a graphical interface for controlling Predator's dashcam functionality. Optic is designed to run on a low-powered computer, alongside Predator, and provides a simple interface for controlling dashcam recording over a network. Users can connect to Optic from a phone, tablet, or other network-enabled device with a web browser. Full installations can even include a dedicated control interface.

While the initial installation and setup process requires some technical knowledge, Optic is designed to be extremely easy to use after the configuration process is completed. As such, users who want to take advantage of Predator's dashcam functionality can have their installer setup Predator and Optic on their behalf.


## Features

### Easy

Optic is intended to be simple and easy to user, just like a commercially available dashcam would be.

### Compatible

Optic works through nearly any web browser, and doesn't even require JavaScript for its core functionality. Whether you're using a modern fully-featured browser, or a minimalist lightweight one, Optic should work great.
